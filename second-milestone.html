         <h5>Epilepsy Patient (Target User) Motifs</h5>
         <ul>
           <li>Social isolation due to stigma from their disease</li>
           <li>Trouble finding employment -- also due to stigmatization</li>
           <li>Intensely anxiety-inducing side-effects such as sudden unexpected death in 1% of patients</li>
           <li>Harsh treatments for stubborn cases</li>

         <h5>Scenarios</h5>
         <h6>Karen's Social Life</h6>
         <p>Problem: Karen(20) is an extroverted young adult who enjoys people's company, but is faced with anxiety/fear and stigmatization due to her epilepsy. Despite her having epilepsy, she still
            makes a strong effort to engage with her friends and not let her epilepsy hold her back. Her worst
            fears are realized one night at a party when a seizure takes hold of her. While her body uncontrollably feels the seizure, people gawk and laugh at her. Many bystanders do not understand her 
            condition, and those who do insensitively react to her seizure. After the this poor experience, Karen has
            trouble coping, and moving on from the event, or engaging in future social interactions due to embarrassment/fear. Karen starts searching out
            online resources to help with her emotional problems from epilepsy and finds our application. After receiving some guidance from the application on where to start, 
            she takes advantage of the educational resources there. After completing the modules and practicing different strategies to lower her stress and rebuild her self confidence, 
            Karen feels well equipped with skills to better handle herself emotionally.

         <h6>Dan's Work</h6>
         <p>Dan, a 30 year old male, battles with his anxiety daily, struggling to get out of bed and go to work with a looming fear over his head. 
            Will my employer find out about my epilepsy? Will they fire me because they think I am a risk? Despite his constant stress, Dan has managed to float by so far 
            but has not established a stable life for himself yet. After being let go at his last job, it was not easy to just find a job but also to build up self 
            confidence to start searching for one in the first place. Though he lives in an urban area and job opportunities are seemingly endless, he is unable to bring 
            himself to try. It is people like Dan who lack direction and guidance to overcome the daily challenges epilepsy poses, in regards not to just social life but 
            also work life. 
              Dan finds our application through a online community of people living with epilepsy. It  designed to educate people with epilepsy to give them 
            the tools to take control of their life. Dan began to use the program and after an initial set of questions was recommended a starting point to begin his support. 
            He completes many of the stress control exercises like breathing techniques allowing him to curb anxiety attacks before they are able to take hold. He was able to 
            watch helpful techniques in properly explaining his epileptic condition when necessary, and encountered abundant positive reinforcement encouraging him to recognize 
            his condition but not let it hold him back from living how he truly wanted. Within a few weeks of his support through our application, he manages to set up a job 
            interview with a local company and feels confident he can land the job.

         <h6>Hank's Relationship</h6>
         <p>Hank (43) is a middle aged male with epilepsy who is having trouble maintaining a relationship with his wife Mary(41). Hank is a passionate person and in an ideal 
            world would take his partner on many adventurous trips to explore nature together. He dreams of going on hikes, paddling a canoe and of taking Mary on exotic 
            vacations where they could walk beaches together away from the hustle and bustle of their city life in Boston. Unfortunately Hank feels true fear when he opens 
            his laptop to look into planning a trip, it seems at every step of the process his mind runs with countless fears that result in him being unable to end up booking 
            anything at all. Mary and him have enjoyed the last two years married together but Hank worries that Mary will only entertain the same “dinner at home” date night 
            for so long before she grows tired of the same thing over and over again. He has made up his mind that unless he is able to show off his spontaneous and fun side, 
            his time with his wife will be far shorter than he wishes. He feels that epilepsy only allows him to be half the man he is in his mind.
              By chance while searching for epilepsy friendly vacations, he finds our application built for people like him. He realizes after completing training modules that 
            his epilepsy does not need to hold him back from exploring the world with the woman he loves. He engages with many exercises designed to break the mental stigma 
            people suffering with epilepsy have about themselves. By breaking the stigma in Hank’s mind, he is able to build up the confidence and trust in himself to take Mary 
            on a trip she will never forget.

         <h5>Use Case</h5>
          <h6>New proposal</h6>
          <p><em>User</em> refers to a patient suffering from epilepsy, and experiencing negative emotional consequences from their condition. <em>Product</em> 
             refers to the team's web application for emotionally educating and skilling the user.</p>
          <b>Normal course [under normal circumstances what will the user do?]</b>
          <ol>
             <li>The customer arrives on the product's landing page.</li>
             <li>The user creates an account, or sign into their existing account.</li>
             <li>The product asks the users to rank themselves on four categories of emotional problems that commonly pose a problem to
                 epilepsy patients: <em>problem solving, taking a second look, recognizing stigma, and stress management</em> (how do you feel about _____?) in order to uncover
                 what pains them about their epilepsy.</li>
             <li>The user answers those questions.</li>
             <li>The product determines what the user suffers with most out of the four categories based on how they rated themself.</li>
             <li>The product presents the user a series of video content (a "course") created in collaboration with professional epilepsy physicians to help patients improve in the area that they suffer
                 from most (from the above step).</li>
             <li>The user watches the course video content.</li>
             <li>The product presents the user with some exercises to test their retention of course content.</li>
             <li>The user completes the presented exercises.</li>
             <li>The user makes another rating of their feelings in the current course's category after completing the educational course.</li>
             <li>The user makes significant emotional progress (their ending emotional valence is more positive than it was at the outset, determined based on their ratings).</li>
             <li>The user takes knowledge and skills back into their daily lives, where they can use it to overcome their emotional roadblocks
                 that face them in their daily lives.</li>
             <li>The user's quality of life improves.</li>
          </ol>
          <b>Alternate course(s) [what happens if the user does not take the expected course?]</b>
          <ol start="11">
            <li>If the user has not made significant emotional progress, they desire to grow further in other areas:
              <ol>
                <li>The product reccomends the course it decides that the user is the second most likely to benefit from.</li>
                <li>The user starts again from step #5</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <!-- <h6>Old</h6>
          <ol>
             <li>In all cases, the target users can go to the website and browse the content from four categories: problem solving, taking a second look,
             recognizing stigma, and stress management -- four areas that commonly plague epilepsy patients.</li>
             <li>The patient gets a broad overview of each of the
               four sections </li>
             <li>The patient makes a choice to dive deeper into a section to start with, and rate their own feelings/position at the outset before watching
                 video contents from each module in-depth and complete the corresponding exercises.</li>
             <li>Ideally, the patient will come away with a better understanding of the facts associated with their condition, and
               they should have a resource in the web application to return to for future help.</li>
         </ol> -->
         <h5>Requirements</h5>
         <ol>
             <li>(Data) Patients' information should be kept securely due to the sensitive nature.</li>
             <li>(Data) The patient must enter their rating of their feelings on a scale of negative to positive valence in regards to the topic of each
                  module at the outset and end of that module.</li>
             <li>(Technical) The technology must be able to run in a web browser environment on mobile or desktop.</li>
             <li>(Functional) The website can track a patient's emotional progress as they accomplish subsequent sections of the web application.</li>
             <li>(Environment) The web application must be of soothing color, not too flashy or animated in order to avoid triggering seizures.</li>
