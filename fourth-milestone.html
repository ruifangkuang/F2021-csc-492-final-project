         <h5>Instructions</h5>
         <p>
           Use the link below to access our prototype (will open in new page). 
           <a class="btn btn-small btn-secondary" target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/Syi2nLanBhq06PhieQ62cN/Online-Learning-Platform-(Community)?node-id=183%3A4">Prototype link</a><br>
           Press the play button in the top right corner (circled in red in the image below) to start interacting with the prototype.
           <img class="persona" src="proto-start-directions.png" /><br>
           From there, you will be able to run a mock interaction with the product.

                     on the slider bar for a scale out of 100). To reconcile this, along with changing the scale to 1-10 as opposed to 1-100,
                     we will simply make the options the integers betweeen 1 and 10.
