         <h5>Instructions</h5>
         <p>
           Use the link below to access our prototype (will open in new page). 
           <a class="btn btn-small btn-secondary" target="_blank" href="https://www.figma.com/file/Syi2nLanBhq06PhieQ62cN/Online-Learning-Platform-(Community)?node-id=183%3A4">Prototype link</a><br>
           Press the play button in the top right corner (circled in red in the image below) to start interacting with the prototype.
           <img class="persona" src="proto-start-directions.png" /><br>
           From there, you will be able to run a mock interaction with the product.

                 <td>This is important. We can show the user an icon (in the top right of the screen) that shows their profile/username
                     to show them that they have been logged in. Furthermore, we can tell the user, when they are being signed up,
                     why we need to track their emotional feelings data and what it will be used for

                 <td>The complaint was that the possible selections on the slider should be cleanly divisible (we had seven "options"
                     on the slider bar for a scale out of 100). To reconcile this, along with changing the scale to 1-10 as opposed to 1-100,
                     we will simply make the options the integers betweeen 1 and 10.

                     the application flow -- especially on the main landing page.
